## What is Node.js ?

Node.js lets you *easily* build networked software (websites, applications "apps"
using JavaScript).

Node.js is not "*point-and-click*" like WordPress, SquareSpace or Salesforce.com;
you will need to *write* some "code". But as I will demonstrate, that's
a *lot* easier than it sounds (if you're *new* to writing code),
gives you more power/flexibility and puts you in full control.
